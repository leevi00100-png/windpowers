# 2026-02-07 - Nordic Wind Power Dashboard

## Project Status

**Repository:** leevi00100-png/windpowers

### Vercel Deployment
- **Issue:** Environment mismatch error - `"--prebuilt" option was used with target environment "production", but prebuilt output was built with target environment "preview"`
- **Fix applied:** Commit `500ca7e` - "Fix Vercel deployment: properly specify environment for pull/build/deploy"
- **Current state:** Workflow run #18 queued (awaiting execution)

### Tests
- ✅ All tests passing (runs #4, #5)

### Key Decisions
- **Token security:** Vercel token accidentally exposed in chat, user revoked and added via GitHub UI as secret
- **Color scheme:** Removed colored backgrounds from price forecast (made neutral gray) to avoid confusion with wind speed colors (red/yellow tones)

### UI Changes Complete
- Legend panel visibility fixed
- Map draggable issue fixed (z-index: 0)
- Mobile toggle button added for collapsible panels
- Price forecast vertical layout
- Zoom controls moved to bottom-right
- Panel organization: weather left, electricity right
